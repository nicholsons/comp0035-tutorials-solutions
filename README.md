# COMP0035 2025-26 Weekly practical activities

This repository contains a solution to each set of weekly activities.

These are solutions you could get to if you follow the activity instructions. That is, they are not intended as
perfectly efficient Python code, but are hopefully consistent with the instructions from the weekly activity sets.

There are of course other solutions, and may be more elegant/efficient than these!
